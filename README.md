# Academic Manager Rails API
This is a system for streamlining the management of a school's academic performance and resource allocation. It will also act as an academic monitoring and communication tool for the schoolâ€™s stakeholders(Teachers, School Management, Parents, and Students)

## Problem Statement,
Am just creating this for my profile and a demo for my students as well.
Also addresses some of the challenges that a school has in terms of monitoring students' performance and reporting the same to parents/guardians.

## Objectives
I intend to make the system as simple as possible by having a very intuitive CRUDy user interface that will be hooked to a very well-documented Rails API backend
